## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this project I learned a lot about using grid for a site layout. It was my first attempt at using grid outside of a lesson or tutorial. I made quite a few mistakes along the way but I learned a lot about proper prior planning. After reconfiguring my layout a few times I got the hang off laying out my columns and rows and using named areas. I thought it was a little tedious at first to set up the named areas, but it made it so much simpler to rearrange the layout for a responsive design. 



### Continued development

The JS portion for this project was really challenging. I've just started learning and nothing I had learned up to this point was of any help. I watched countless tutorials and tried borrowing bits from different ones, but it wasn't quite working. I finally found a great tutorial on dev.to by ljc-dev. It was really frustrating not knowing enough JS to accomplish a simple menu. My main focus going forward will be learning JS.

### Useful resources

- [Hamburger menu JS tutorial](https://dev.to/ljcdev/easy-hamburger-menu-with-js-2do0) - I really liked the clean straightforward code used in this JS tutorial. 
- [CSS Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob/featured) - This is an amazing YouTube channel for learning CSS. If you haven't seen any Of Kevin's videos I highly recomend      you check it out.
